# One workflow to rule them all

Without a proper workflow, you are going to get yourself into a lot of trouble working on real software in a real world with a real team. Really real life is like that.

What amazes me is I rarely see a post on the Interwebs meant to teach people Git that uses this flow, which is a shame, because I have run into it time and time again while pairing with experts.

## Creating a new Git project

Create a folder, any folder. Do it in the Terminal of course, because we are trying to make you a hacker of programs:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/dev/some/project/folder
```

The `-p` on that will keep the terminal happy if you decide to create nested folders that don't yet exist. Replace that path with something that makes sense on your machine.

I would suggest you keep stuff in ~/dev though.
