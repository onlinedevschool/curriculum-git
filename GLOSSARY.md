Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. I like to think of Git as a source code time machine.

# Command Line Tools

The OSX Command line tools are a collection of build utilities, commonly known as `build-essential` in the programming community. It contains open source linkers and compilers for building C programs on OSX.

# Terminal

The terminal is a window that runs low level commands, outside of the operating system GUI. It is the primary tool of a software developer, and is often depicted in movies as the go to Hacker program, which it is. Inside the terminal you can run hundreds of UNIX programs, perform network operations, and even reconfigure your computer.

# Homebrew

Homebrew is the 'missing' package manager for OSX. It is essentially a collection of `recipes` on how to build various terminal applications from C into stand-alone executables. Homebrew is extensively used on the Mac to install programmer utilities.

Curl is used in command lines or scripts to transfer data. It is also used in cars, television sets, routers, printers, audio equipment, mobile phones, tablets, settop boxes, media players and is the internet transfer backbone for thousands of software applications totally affecting more than one billion users.

# Source Control Management

This is the concept and toolset of managing multiple versions of a great deal of many files, worked on by a multitude of developers. Work should never be lost if you employ an SCM.
