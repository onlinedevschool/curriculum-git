# Git commit

Git commit does what you probably think it does. It cements the changes you have staged. When this happens a `version` is created. This version can be a point in time that we can `jump` to.

```sh
git commit -m'My first awsome git commit!'
```

You now have a new 'version' and your `Git tree` is `clean`. There are many other ways of saving a commit message but for now this will suffice.

You can always read the [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) from the authors to get more in depth info. There is of course also always:

```sh
man git
```
