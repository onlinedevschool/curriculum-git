# Git init

```sh
cd ~/dev/some/project/folder
git init
```

If you now do a `git log` you can see that we have ourselves a new Git directory, but nothing is 'saved' just yet. In fact, we don't have anything yet to save!

Create a file inside of the new Git project folder. It can be a text file, a source code file, an image. It really doesn't matter, but don't stick anything too big in there. ;)

Now that you have a file, create another folder within the folder you are in:

```sh
mkdir new_folder
```

Now we have some files we can add and commit.
